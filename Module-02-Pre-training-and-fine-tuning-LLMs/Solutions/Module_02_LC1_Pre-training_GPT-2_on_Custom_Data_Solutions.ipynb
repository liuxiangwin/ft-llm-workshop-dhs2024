They also have all sorts of tools, add-ons, and such that are necessary for truly high quality video productions, such as lights, sounds, view screens, an digital hookups, better low light conditions, zoom, and so on. These are amazing devices Your mobile phone has a shitty lens, bad views, and generally does a lot of compression on the video, losing a lot of quality that may be needed for use on a bigger screen for when it gets compressed again from cable/sat providers to your home. The TV companies need to film in the absolute best possible methods, bandwidth and such to be able to get the best picture to the end user after it goes through a whole lifecycle before it hits your eyes on your brand new 65\" TV.\\' So why don\\'t they use 4K? Well, there\\'s no point, no one is broadcasting in 4K except some specialized events, and it would take a lot of effort to get new equipment, and then reconvert to 720p or 1080i all of your content you shoot... and you shoot tons and tons of footage.',\n",

       "  '4K doesn\\'t mean anything about the quality of the video. All it says is the size of the video. Mobile phone companies use this to mislead you into thinking its better than it is. Companies with those cameras are often shooting MUCH higher bandwidth (i.e. better picture), with much superior lenses and equipment (better picture), and doing so often in uncompressed, or lightly compressed video (or lossless compression) video (better picture). They also have all sorts of tools, add-ons, and such that are necessary for truly high quality video productions, such as lights, sounds, view screens, an digital hookups, better low light conditions, zoom, and so on. These are amazing devices Your mobile phone has a shitty lens, bad views, and generally does a lot of compression on the video, losing a lot of quality that may be needed for use on a bigger screen for when it gets compressed again from cable/sat providers to your home. The TV companies need to film in the absolute best possible methods, bandwidth and such to be able to get the best picture to the end user after it goes through a whole lifecycle before it hits your eyes on your brand new 65\" TV.\\' So why don\\'t they use 4K? Well, there\\'s no point, no one is broadcasting in 4K except some specialized events, and it would take a lot of effort to get new equipment, and then reconvert to 720p or 1080i all of your content you shoot... and you shoot tons and tons of footage.',\n",
       "  \"Firstly, there's no zoom on a phone. A lot of the expense goes on lenses that allow zoom and for different looks for the footage which you are very limited with using a phone. Secondly, there's no point streaming in very high quality if the audience can't use it. It takes a good computer or a proper TV or monitor to show 4K footage\"],\n",

Additionally, literally being heavier helps. A heavy camera has a lot of inertia which means that when you breathe and move around, the camera tends to move less than a lighter camera. If you tied a 50 pound rock to your cell phone, your videos would appear much smoother and less jumpy than just your cell phone alone... no technology required.<|end|>\",\n",

Bouncing, or ping-ponging, was a way to record more instruments / vocals back in the day when you were limited by the amount of tracks you could record on tape. On an 8 track recorder, you could record on the first 7 tracks, mix and EQ everything, and then dump it down to track #8. Now you\\'ve got 7 more tracks you can work with so you\\'ve turned a 7 track recording into a 14 track recording. Always nice for when you have to add more cowbell.<|end|>']"
